# Sentimental-Analysis-On-Movie-Reviews
       Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie. While providing a numerical/stars 
    rating to a movie tells us about the success or failure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews 
    is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of the movie. A textual movie review tells us 
    about the the strong and weak points of the movie and deeper analysis of a movie review can tell us if the 
    movie in general meets the expectations of the reviewer.
    
            One of the most important elements for businesses is being in touch with its customer base. It is vital 
    for these firms to know exactly what consumers or clients think of new and established products or services, recent 
    initiatives, and customer service offerings. Sentiment analysis is one way to accomplish this necessary task.
    
        Sentiment Analysis is a field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds models that try to identify and 
    classify attributes of the expression e.g.:
          • Polarity: if the speaker expresses a positive or negative opinion,
          • Subject: the thing that is being talked about,
          • Opinion holder: the person, or entity that expresses the opinion.
    
        In a world where we generate 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day, sentiment analysis has become a key tool 
    for making sense of that data. This has allowed companies to get key insights and automate all kind of 
    processes.
    
        Sentiment Analysis can help to automatically transform the unstructured information into structured data of 
    public opinions about products, services, brands, politics or any other topic that people can express opinions 
    about. This data can be very useful for commercial applications like marketing analysis, public 
    relations, product reviews, net promoter scoring, product feedback, and customer service.

# Conclusion
        Finally, we implemented the recursive neural tensor networks to train a multi-class sentiment analyzer
    The training of standard RNTN was computationally very expensive. This motivated us to introduce the 
    low-rank RNTN. We showed that the low-rank RNTN can achieve comparable accuracies to that of standard RNTN 
    much faster. This better training performance of the low-rank RNTN enables us to train several.

        Intelligent systems can be developed which can provide the users with comprehensive reviews of 
    movies, products, services etc. without requiring the user to go through individual reviews, he can
    directly take decisions based on the results provided by the intelligent systems.
